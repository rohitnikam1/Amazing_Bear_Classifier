# Amazing Bear Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network

In this project, we build a bear detector using deep learning. It will discriminate between three types of bear: grizzly, black, and teddy bears. We fine-tune a pre-trained resnet18 model to classify the three bear categories. The dataset contains 900 images. Our system reaches
