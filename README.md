# Amazing Bear Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network

In this project, we build a bear detector using deep learning. It will discriminate between three types of bear: grizzly, black, and teddy bears. 

There are many images on the internet of each type of bear that can be used. We then fine tune a pre-trained
